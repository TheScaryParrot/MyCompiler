HS- & HHScompiler are depricated. 
THScompiler currently has working scanner and parser, just missing some features.
Optimization and code generation is not yet present:

You can try running ./THScompiler testFile.THS to see a debug print of the generated Parse Tree.
You can also create your own testfile similar to testFile.THS. Keep in mind that some features are still missing especially useful Error Handling.
